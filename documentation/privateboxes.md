Matthew Ahrenstein's Private Vagrant Boxes
==========================================
This repository contains a few Vagrant boxes that require access to boxes stored in S3 with a bucket policy restricting access by IP. Unfortunately this is because they contain an operating system and/or software that is not free to distribute.
I included them in this repo because I use them quite regularly and wanted to keep all of my boxes in one place.

Requesting S3 access to private boxes 
-------------------------------------
At this time I can only provide access to these boxes if you are working directly with me on a project. If you think you should have access to one or more of these boxes then reach out to me on Hangouts or via E-mail.

1. fusion-mavericks
2. fusion-yosemite
3. fusion-elcapitan
  
Restricted Boxes 
------------
The following boxes will not be shared with anyone due to their high potential for abuse.

1. DeDRM
